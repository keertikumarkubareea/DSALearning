# DSA Practice Repository ðŸ’»  

Welcome to my **DSA Practice Repository**! ðŸŽ‰ This is my personal space to strengthen my skills in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** while combining structured learning and hands-on problem-solving.  

Here, I'm diving deep into the concepts covered in the book **"Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Python" by Dr. Basant Agarwal** and tackling real-world interview questions from **LeetCode**. To make it more relevant, Iâ€™ll use a curated list of company-wise LeetCode problems sourced from [hxu296's GitHub](https://github.com/hxu296/leetcode-company-wise-problems-2022/tree/main/companies).

## ðŸ“š **Learning Resources**  

### 1. **Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Python**  
This book offers a fantastic foundation for learning DSA using Python. My plan is to work through the chapters, implement examples, and solve exercises provided in the book. Iâ€™ll document my solutions in the `book-exercises/` folder.

### 2. **LeetCode Problems**  
LeetCode is my go-to platform for practicing coding interview problems. Iâ€™m specifically focusing on **company-wise problems**, working on challenges from companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, among others. This will help me sharpen my problem-solving skills while preparing for interviews.
